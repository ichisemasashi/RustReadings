# [Playpen](#playpen){.header}

The [Rust Playpen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-playpen) is a way
to experiment with Rust code through a web interface. This project is
now commonly referred to as [Rust
Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/).

## [Using it with `mdbook`](#using-it-with-mdbook){.header}

In [`mdbook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), you can make code
examples playable and editable.

    fn main() {
        println!("Hello World!");
    }

This allows the reader to both run your code sample, but also modify and
tweak it. The key here is the adding the word `editable` to your
codefence block separated by a comma.

```` markdown
```rust,editable
//...place your code here
```
````

Additionally, you can add `ignore` if you want `mdbook` to skip your
code when it builds and tests.

```` markdown
```rust,editable,ignore
//...place your code here
```
````

## [Using it with docs](#using-it-with-docs){.header}

You may have noticed in some of the [official Rust
docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/) a button that says \"Run\", which
opens the code sample up in a new tab in Rust Playground. This feature
is enabled if you use the #\[doc\] attribute called
[`html_playground_url`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/the-doc-attribute.html#html_playground_url).
